        <p><br>Hello! My Name is Gavin. I am currenly a third year comp-sci student at Oregon State University. My experience in web developement is
        incredibly limited. The most complicated <br>thing I've ever done was using inspect element to change an image. Since campuswire is now defunct I haven't signed up for it. I have signed up for Ed though! </p>
        <h3>What do you hope to learn from this class?</h3>
        <p>What I am most anticipating this term is how to make a webpage with both form and function, as opposed to this page which is pure function.</p>


        <h3>What is your most unique experience?</h3>
        <p>My most unique experience was in freshman year of college my favorite musician <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1t9KewtUvFMq6q7FRX1nHC?si=GhQI9HZOShu7QBBawCC5pA">
            Kill Bill</a> took my phone on stage twice in one night! It was a great time.</p>
