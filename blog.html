    <p>The most difficult thing with this assignment was starting it. Coding in HTML isn't difficult, but it felt like I was missing the tools that I needed to work proficiently.
         With every element I would go to the browser and search how to center something or round the border of the image. I knew literally nothing, so everything on the webpage is information I learnt
        ie, importing images, centering text, adding headers. The most important resource for me when working was honestly google. I would search what I was looking for and since my questions are so surface level it the fastest to google everything.
